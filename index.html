            <!-- Paragraphed Bio-->
            <p>I'm a communications training developer in the BPO industry and I currently design training
                programs for
                customer service trainees, agents, and their leaders. On the side, I am also an English as a Second
                Language teacher and I have over 24 years experience. In that time, I was a a director of studies for
                English First.</p>

            <p>Teaching English opened so many doors for me as I traveled the world working. I worked in Warsaw, Poland
                for 6 years, Casablanca, Morocco for two, and Surabaya, Indonesia for 8. Those 16 years molded me into
                the person I am today and I am ever greatful for the experience. </p>

            <p>I've chosen to get into coding as I am a very creative individual and seeing the endless posibilities,
                I'm very excited to get started.</p>
