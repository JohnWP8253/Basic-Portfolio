            <div class="bio">
                <p>I'm a communications training developer in the BPO industry and I currently design training
                    programs for
                    customer service trainees, agents, and their leaders. On the side, I am also an English as a Second
                    Language teacher and I have over 24 years experience. In that time, I was a director of studies
                    for
                    English First.</p>

                <p>Teaching English opened so many doors for me as I traveled the world working. I worked in Warsaw,
                    Poland
                    for 6 years, Casablanca, Morocco for two, and Surabaya, Indonesia for 8. It turned me into a polyglot which lends itself to coding. Those 16 years molded me
                    into
                    the person I am today and I am ever greatful for the experience. </p>

                <p>I've chosen to get into coding as I am a very creative individual and seeing the endless
                    posibilities,
                    I'm very excited to get started.</p>
